<p class="titlecase"><u>Practical 3-Determintion of g by a free-fall method</u>
<p class="whitecase">This investigation involves finding the value of the acceleration due to gravity (g) from finding how the time taken for a ball (dropped from a fixed position) to pass through two light gates varies as the vertical distance between the two light gates varies. </p>
<p class="subtitlecase">Theory - key formulas</p>
<p class="whitecase"> h = ut+gt^2/2 (where h is the vertical distance between the two light gates(m), u is the velocity at which the ball reaches the first light gate (ms-1), t is time (secs), and g is acceleration due to gravity (ms-2).</br>
<p class="whitecase">In the form y=mx+c, 2h/2 = gt +2u, making the gradient give g, and the intercept of a graph 2u.</br>
<p class="subtitlecase">Equipment</p>
<p class="whitecase">-Stand and clamp, -Electromagnet (another clamp could be used to produce the same effect - dropping the ball at the same height each time), -Low voltage variable DC supply (powers the electromagnet if used), 2kg mass,steel ballbearing, -Two light gates, -An electronic data logger with precision of 1ms or better, -A pad to protect the bench when the ballbearing lands, -A metre ruler</p>
<p class="subtitlecase">Technical Information</p>
<p class="whitecase">-While the electromagent can be conveniant and guarantee a clean release, a perhaps easier method would be to support the ballbearing with a clamp at its desired height, and open and close it to release and hold the ballbearing at the right time.</br>
<p class="whitecase">-Several trials and adjustments will be required to ensure that the ballbearing falls directly through the light gates. This often requires a high level of precision as the light gates have to be in exactly the right position.</br>
<p class="whitecase">-The upper light gate should be connected to the data logger to start the timing. The lower light gate shold be connected to stop the timing.</br>
<p class="whitecase">-The 2kg mass is used as a counterweight to ensure that the stand does not topple over (an alternative would be to use a G-clamp to clamp the stand to the bench).</br>
<p class="whitecase">-A 2kg mass can be used as a couterweight to ensure the stand does not topple over (a G-clamp is a viable alternative)</p>
<p class="subtitlecase">Suggested Method Outline</p>
<p class="whitecase">Set up the apparatus as shown in the diagram</br>
<p class="whitecase">The height between the starting position of the ballbearing and the upper light gate should be kept constant, so that the velocity, u, with which the ballbearing reaches this light gate is also constant.</br>
<p class="whitecase">Adjust the position of the lower light gate so that h is 0.500m measured using the metre ruler.</br>
<p class="whitecase">Switch on the supply of the electromagnet and hang the ballbearing from it (or fit the ballbearing into the clamp if a mechanical release mechanism is being used).</br>
<p class="whitecase">Reset the data logger to zero and switch off the electromagnet (or open the clamp).</br>
<p class="whitecase">Read the time on the data logger once the ballbearing passed through the light gates.</br>
<p class="whitecase">Take repeat readings to find the mean time, t.</br>
<p class="whitecase">Reduce h by 0.050m and repeat the procedure down to a value of 0.250m (lower values than this make it difficult to obtain accurate timings).</br>
<p class="whitecase">Plot a graph of 2h/t against t.</br>
<p class="whitecase">Draw the best straight line of best fit through the points and find the grdient (the graph should be a straight line with intercept 2u).</br>
<p class="subtitlecase">My Results</p>
<p class="whitecase">After I completed this experiment, I found my calculated value of the gravitational constant to be 10.2ms-2. This is can be seen as fairly accurate when compared to the actual value,: 9.81ms-2 to 3sf (a degree of error is expected due to the gradient being calculated by a line of best fit). I calculated the velocity to be 1.735ms-1 as the ball entered the first light gate. This value would be different for every experiment.</p>
