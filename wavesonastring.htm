<p class="titlecase"><u>Practical 1 -Stationary Waves on a String</u>
<p class="whitecase">This investigation concerns how the frequency of a standing wave on a string is affected by the length of the string, the mass per unit length of the string and the tension in the string. This involves setting up a standing wave on a string and varying the length(through uing a moveable bridge), the weight the string supports (therefore increasing the tension) and he mass per unit length of string (which can be changed through using different strings with different measures for mass per unit length). </p>
<p class="subtitlecase">Theory - key formulas</p>
<p class="whitecase">The speed of the travelling waves on the string is c = fλ where f is frequency (in Hz) and λ is wavelength (in m)</br>
<p class="whitecase">When the string is vibrating in its fundamental frequency, λ = 2l</br>
<p class="whitecase">Hence c = 2fl</br>
<p class="whitecase">The gradient is l/fl so c is given by 2/gradient is ms-1</br>
<p class="whitecase">The speed is also given by c = √(T/m) where T is the tension in the string in N and m is the mass per unit length of the string in kgm^-1
<p class="subtitlecase">Equipment</p>
<p class="whitecase">-Signal generator, -Vibration generator, -Stand, -G Clamp, -1.5m length of string, Pulley which can be clamped to the bench, -Wooden bridges slightly higher than the pulley, -100g masses on a holder, -Metre ruler, -Digital scales with precision 0.1g or better.</p>
<p class="subtitlecase">Technical Information</p>
<p class="whitecase">-The signal generator should be operated for about 20 minutes in order for the frequency to stabilise</br>
<p class="whitecase">-The power output should be used. The output level should be turned up to a value which gives steady vibrations of the vibration generator.</br>
<p class="whitecase">-The string should be tied to the stand and passed through a hole in the vibration generator</br>
<p class="whitecase">-The bridge should be at the same height as the hole</br>
<p class="whitecase">-A 2kg mass can be used as a couterweight to ensure the stand does not topple over (a G-clamp is a viable alternative)</p>
<p class="subtitlecase">Suggested Method Outline</p>
<p class="whitecase">Set up the apparatus as shown in the diagram</br>
<p class="whitecase">Adjust the position of the bridge so that l is 1.000m measured using a metre ruler </br>
<p class="whitecase">Increase the frequency of the signal generator from zero until the string resonates at it fundamental frequency (first harmonic) as indicated in the diagram with a node at each end and a central antinode.</br>
<p class="whitecase">Read and record the frequency f, on the signal generator dial.</br>
<p class="whitecase">Repeat the procedure with l = 0.900, 0.800, 0.700, 0.600, and 0.500</br>
<p class="whitecase">Obtain a second and third set of results by repeating the experiment and find the mean value of f and for each value of t</br>
<p class="whitecase">Plot a graph of mean l/f against l.</br>
<p class="whitecase">Draw the best straight line of best fit through the points and find the gradient, from this, the above formulas can be used to calculate the speed of the wave.</br>
<p class="whitecase">With a 100g mass hanging from the string, T = 0.981N. m can be found by weighing the 1.5m length of string on an electronic balance, converting this into kg, and dividing by 1.5</br>
<p class="whitecase">The experiment can be repeated with different masses hanging from the string, and different thicknesses of string to investigate the effect of changing T and m</br>
<p class="whitecase">Doubling the fundamental frequency while keeping l, T and m constant will cause the string to resonate in its second harmonic (with nodes at either end, a central node, and two antinodes). Tripling the frequency will give the third harmonic, and so on.</br>
<p class="subtitlecase">My Results</p>
<p class="whitecase">I discovered, after undertaking this experiment myself, that as the length was increased, the average frequency decreased, as mass was increased, the average frequency increased, and as mass per unit length increased, average frequency decreased.</p>
