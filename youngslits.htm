<p class="titlecase"><u>Practical 2 -Interference effects f Young's slit and diffraction by a diffraction grating</u>
<p class="whitecase">This investigation is split up into two parts, one investigates the effect of changing the distance between a double slit filter on a laser and a screen and another involves using a diffraction grating. Both methods sould allow the wavelength to be found.</p>
<p class="subtitlecase">Theory - key formulas</p>
<p class="whitecase">λ = ws / D  where λ is wavelength (m), w is fringe spacing (m), s is slit seperation (m), and D is distance from the slits to the screen (m)</br>
<p class="whitecase">In a graph of w against D, the gradient is λ /s</br>
<p class="whitecase">nλ = dsinƟ where n is the order of the diffraction pattern, d is the grating spacing,(1/number of lines per metre (m)), λ is the wavelength of light.</br>
<p class="subtitlecase">Equipment</p>
<p class="whitecase">For the double slit experiment: –Class II optical laser with output 1 mW or less, -Darkened slide with double slit ‘rulings’ (usually 1 mm slit separation), -Vernier callipers to measure slit separation, -Adjustable single slit (might be unnecessary with the laser), -White screen (non reflective, a wall may be viable), -A metre ruler. </p>
<p class="whitecase">For the diffraction grating experiment: -Class II optical laser with output 1 mW or less, -Plane transmission diffraction grating, -White screen (non reflective, a wall may be viable), -Metre ruler.
<p class="subtitlecase">Technical Information</p>
<p class="whitecase">-The laboratory should be partially darkened to ensure the laser is visible</br>
<p class="whitecase">-Ensure that the lasers are used safely and appropriately, not pointed in anyones eyes etc.</br>
<p class="subtitlecase">Suggested Method Outline - Double Slit Experiment</p>
<p class="whitecase">The laboratory is partially darkened, so that the laser light can be seen, ensuring that lasers are used safely.</br>
<p class="whitecase">Set up the apparatus as shown in the diagram, with the laser illuminating the double slit and the screen a distance D of initially about 1 metre. (With the laser the single slit might not be required, provided the laser beam is wide enough to illuminate across the double slit).</br>
<p class="whitecase">Carefully adjust the position of the laser until the light spreads evenly over the two slits. An interference pattern should be visible on the screen.</br>
<p class="whitecase">The fringe width (or fringe spacing), w, can be measured by measuring across a large number of visible fringes. (Take care when counting – counting from the first bright fringe to the fifth bright fringe would represent four fringe widths!)</br>
<p class="whitecase">Use the metre ruler to measure D</br>
<p class="whitecase">A measurement of the slit separation, s, is required. The value could be measured with vernier callipers or travelling microscope. This value may be indicated on the double slit.</br>
<p class="whitecase">The value of D can be changed from approximately 0.5m to 1.5m and the fringe width measured for each value of D</br>
<p class="whitecase">A graph of w on the y-axis against D can be plotted, with a gradient of λ/s. From either this or use of the formula λ = ws/D, the wavelength of the light can be found. </br>
<p class="subtitlecase">Suggested Method Outline - Diffraction Grating Experiment</p>
<p class="whitecase">The laboratory is partially darkened, so that the laser light can be seen, ensuring that lasers are used safely.</br>
<p class="whitecase">The apparatus is set up as shown, with the laser illuminating the diffraction grating and the screen a distance D of initially 1 metre.</br>
<p class="whitecase">Carefully adjust the position of the diffraction grating so that the diffraction grating is perpendicular to the beam of light from the laser.</br>
<p class="whitecase">The diffraction pattern should be visible on the screen. The number of orders shown will depend on the line spacing of the diffraction grating</br>
<p class="whitecase">The angles Ɵ1 and Ɵ2 can be determined by measuring the distances h1 , h2 and D. (This gives the tangent of the angles, and hence the angles can be calculated).</br>
<p class="whitecase">The formula nλ = d sinƟ can be used to determine the wavelength of the laser light. </br>
<p class="whitecase">The values of Ɵ for each order, should be measured. A mean value for λ can be calculated from the data.</br>
<p class="subtitlecase">My Results</p>
<p class="whitecase">In this experiment, it should be discovered that as the distance from the double slits to the screen is increased, w should increase, and that when the wavelenghth is calculated, it should be around 630nm, as this is approximately the wavelength of the type of monochromatic light emitted by a red laser. Other lasers may differ. </p>
