<p class="titlecase"><u>Practical 6 - Finding the emf and internal resistance of an electric cell</u>
<p class="whitecase">In this investigation, the emf(electromotive force) and the internal resistance of an electric cell will both be deduced. This will be achieved by producing different readings of voltage and current on a circuit and creating a graph. Unlike other investgations, where a hypothesis can be given, the nature of the experiment makes a hypothetical figure hard to create. However, it should be noted that the emf should be low for cells to be efficient, the advertised value of the battery you use could be quoted.</p>
<p class="subtitlecase">Theory - key formulas</p>
<p class="whitecase">emf = I(R+r) where I is current (Amps), R is load resistance (Ω), and r is internal resistance (Ω).</br>
<p class="whitecase">This equation can be rearranged (using V=IR) to produce emf = V+Ir</br>
<p class="whitecase">V(voltage) = emf - Ir</br>
<p class="whitecase">Therefore, when plotted on a graph of V against I, the gradient will be -r and the intercept should be emf on the y-axis (V=emf-Ir is compared to y=mx+c).</br>
<p class="subtitlecase">Equipment</p>
<p class="whitecase">-Non rechargable cell or battery whose internal emf and internal resistance is being investigated, -Cell holder (or suitable connector to circuit), -Variable resistor (a wire wound rheostat is suitable), -Digital voltmeter (eg 0-10V), -Digital ammeter (eg 0-1A), -Switch, -Connecting leads.</p>
<p class="subtitlecase">Technical Information</p>
<p class="whitecase">-The cells or batteries should be non-rechargable because these have a very low internal resistance, which can be difficult to measure and they can deliver high currents on short circuits.</br>
<p class="whitecase">-Ideally the cells should be fairly new. THe emf and internal resistance of older 'run down' cells will vary during the experiment. It is advisable to switch off the circuit between readings to avoid excessive heat and the cells running down.</br>
<p class="whitecase">-Ensure that the power rating on the variable resistor is adequate for the maximum current used.</br>
<p class="subtitlecase">Suggested Method Outline</p>
<p class="whitecase">Set up the circuit as shown in the diagram. Set the variable resistor to its maximum value</br>
<p class="whitecase">With the switch open record the reading V, on the voltmeter.</br>
<p class="whitecase">Close the switch and take the readings of pd, V on the voltmeter and current, I on the ammeter.</br>
<p class="whitecase">Adjust the variable resistor to obtain pairs of readings of V and I, over the widest possible range.</br>
<p class="whitecase">Open the switch after each pair of readings. Only close it for sufficient time to take each pair of readings.</br>
<p class="whitecase">Plot a graph of V on the y-axis against I.</br>
<p class="whitecase">Plot a graph of mean l/f against l (this graph should be downward sloping, allowing r and emf to be found from the gradient and intercept respectively</br>
<p class="subtitlecase">My Results</p>
<p class="whitecase">When I did the experiment, I found my emf to be 1.47V, pretty close to the advertised emf of the type of battery I used(1.5V). Many different batteries would have a range of emfs, so in order to evaluate accuracy, check if your result correlates with the advertised one. The internal resistance I found to be 0.17Ω, which, as expected, was low in order to ensure that the battery was as efficient as possible.</p>
