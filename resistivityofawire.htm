<p class="titlecase"><u>Practical 5 -Determination of Resistivity of a wire</u>
<p class="whitecase">This investigation will result in the calculation of the resistivity of a certain wire, using an ammeter and voltmeter to record data. In this experiment, the length of the wire is varied (while keeping the exact strand of wire he same). Resistivity is a contant and should be irrespective of the length of a wire.</p>
<p class="subtitlecase">Theory - key formulas</p>
<p class="whitecase">Resistivity is a measure of how resistant a material is, and is calculated by ρ = RA/L , where ρ is resistivity (in Ωm), R is resistivity (in Ω), A is cross section area (in m^2) and L is length (in m) </br>
<p class="whitecase">The gradient of the graph R against I (current in A)</br>
<p class="whitecase">ρ = gradient x A in Ωm </br>
<p class="subtitlecase">Equipment</p>
<p class="whitecase">-1 Metre length of constantan wire, -Low voltage variable DC supply (eg 0-6V), -Ammeter (eg 0-1A with 0.02A precision or better), -Voltmeter (eg 0-5V with 0.1V precision or better), -Two crocodile clips, -Five connecting leads, -Metre ruler, -Micrometer.</p>
<p class="subtitlecase">Technical Information</p>
<p class="whitecase">-The constantan wire should be free from kinks and held as straight as possible when measuring the length</br>
<p class="whitecase">-The thickness of 0.25mm is suggested as this is sufficiently large to measure fairly accurately with the micrometer</br>
<p class="whitecase">A 10cm length of it will have a resistance of around 1Ω, which will allow a resonable accurate determination of its resistance.</br>
<p class="subtitlecase">Suggested Method Outline</p>
<p class="whitecase">Measure the thickness of the constantan wire using the micrometer in at least 3 places and find the mean diameter d. Convert this to metres.</br>
<p class="whitecase">Set up the apparatus as shown in the diagram </br>
<p class="whitecase">Attach the crocodile clips so that l = 1.000m measured on the meter ruler.</br>
<p class="whitecase">Set the voltage, V, to 0,5V and measure the current, I in A.</br>
<p class="whitecase">Calculate the resistance R = V/I in Ω.</br>
<p class="whitecase">Repeat the procedure for l = 0.200, 0.300, 0.400, 0.500, 0.600, 0.700 and 0.800m, increasing V by 0.5V each time to maintain the current at about 0.5A. (this will allow a reasonably accurate measurement of the current, without it being so large that the wire is warmed, which may change its resistance. Switching off the power supply between readings will also keep any heating to a minimum).</br>
<p class="whitecase">Obtain a second (and preferably third) set of results by repeating the experiment and find the mean value of R for each value of I.</br>
<p class="whitecase">Plot a graph of the mean R against I.</br>
<p class="whitecase">Draw the line of best fit through the points and find the gradient (the graph should be a straight line through the origin).</br>
<p class="whitecase">Calculate the cross-sectional area of the wire A = πd^2/4 in m^2</br>

<p class="subtitlecase">My Results</p>
<p class="whitecase">From undertaking the experiment, I discovered that in the strand of constantan wire I used, the resistivity was 4.9 x 10^-7 Ωm. However, for different thicknesses of wire, this figure would be different.</p>
