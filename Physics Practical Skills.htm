<p class="titlecase"><u>Practical Skills</u>
<p class="whitecase">Practicals are an integral part of the AQA AS level Physics course and in order to gain the best mark from them, certain procedures and skills can prove beneficial to learn. Here, a walkthrough is provided which can be applied to virtually all of the practicals you will encounter and will include details of skills.</p>
<p class="subtitlecase">Variables</p>
<p class="whitecase">when given an experiment to conduct, an important first step is to identify the variables used and construct a table accordingly. The <strong>independent variable</strong> is the one you change in the experiment and will often be seen as the first column in a table. The <strong>dependent variable</strong> is the one you measure in the experiment, and in a table is situated next to the independent variable. A <strong>control variable</strong> is something which is kept constant throughout the experiment, this may be written either in a graph or outside of one for use in further calculations including all the values recorded. For example, in an investigation where the effects of different voltages on the amplitude of a circuit are observed, the independent variable is voltage, the dependent, amplitude and the control being temperature, pressure, light conditions, that sort of thing.</p>
<p class="subtitlecase">Equipment</p>
<p class="whitecase">Needless to say, when undertaking an experiment, it helps to know what your equipment does and how to use it safely. In your lessons, how to use the equipment should be explained, if you are struggling seek help from a peer who might be able to explain it for you. It helps to gain a substantial grasp of the equipment and how it works because your practical knowledge might be assessed in the examination!</p>
<p class="subtitlecase">Making your experiment fair</p>
<p class="whitecase">It is very important to ensure that you minimise uncertainty to make your test fair. Uncertainty is caused by one or both of two types of error, <strong>random and systematic</strong>. Random errors can cause readings to be spread about the true value due to the results varying in an unpredictable way. These are hard to tackle and could still arise even with extreme care, for example it is hard to track and account for minimal changes in temperature throughout the experiment. Also, random errors can be present in measurements, arising due to subtle changes in the position of your view of the scale. systematic errors are caused by the environment, such as using an inaccurate clock or a stopwatch which is always (for some weird reason) a second out. The problem with these errors is that they are hard to spot, but when they are found, they can be rectified fairly easily just by using different equipment.</br>

<p class="whitecase">You can integrate many measures into your experiment which can improve accuracy. One of these is to <strong>repeat your experiment a number of times</strong> and record the average (mean) value of these. The more repeats, the more precise the average should be however, in order to ensure that the experiment is not needlessly arduous, 3 repeats should suffice. Also <strong>appropriate equipment</strong> should be used to minimise error, for example, using a micrometer instead of a ruler which provides a much smaller scale for smaller measurements. Using a smaller scale should minimise <strong>percentage error</strong> (the difference between the estimated number and the actual number in comparison to the actual number expressed in percent format). Also, when using equpment such as weighing scales, it is important to calibrate it to reduce <strong>zero errors</strong>(these being where the scale doesnt read zero when it is supposed to). Finally, anomalies can be spotted and excluded from some evaluations by comparison, or during the process of drawing a graph, and subsequently removed from any suggestions regarding relationships between variables.</p>

<p class="subtitlecase">Processing Data</p>
<p class="whitecase">It is often best to draw a table to contain your raw results recorded in the experiment. When the table has been constructed and the experiment completed, there are many ways to further process the data and evaluate if any relationships are present between the variables investigated. One way in which this can be done is by <strong>drawing a graph</strong>. Graphs can make data easier to understand and can illustrate any trend in the data. When drawing a graph, a sensible scale needs to be employed. The graph type of choice for physics tends to be the scatter graph as it can effectively illustrate a <strong>correlation</strong> between the two variables and the strength of any correlation. If as one variable increases, another increases, the two variables are said to be positively correlated, if as one variable increases, another decreases, they are said to be negatively correlated and if there apears to be no relationship between the variables, no correlation is declared.</p>
<p class="subtitlecase">Writeup Structure</p>

<p class="whitecase">It is important to remember that along with directly carrying out practicals, analysis and evaluations from the practical experiments and investigations will need to be undertaken. Below is a possible structure of how the results, analysis and evaluation could be compiled, creating an investigation writeup, which may be of use:</p>
<p class="contentcase">1. Introduce the investigation</br>
<p class="indentcase">This may include any theory or knowledge of the topic you are investigating.</p>
<p class="contentcase">2. Provide a Hypothesis</br>
<p class="indentcase">This may be based on the theory provided or something you learned in class, be sure to fully explain why you support your hypothesis. You may wish to include formulas.</p>
<p class="contentcase">3. Equipment and Illustration</br>
<p class="indentcase">Ensure all the equipment used is listed, draw an illustration if you think this would help.</p>
<p class="contentcase">4. Variable List</br>
<p class="indentcase">List the control, independent and dependent variables in the investiation</p>
<p class="contentcase">5. Method</br>
<p class="indentcase">Write in detail the process you followed to produce your results, write it as if you are instructing someone on how to carry out the experiment.</p>
<p class="contentcase">6. Safety Precautions</br>
<p class="indentcase">Here, list all the safety precautions adhered to throughout the experiment (tip = if you cant think of any, put 'maintain a mature attitude throughout' here!)</p>
<p class="contentcase">7. Conclusion</br>
<p class="indentcase">This is where you discuss the results, compare them to your hypothesis and identify any relationships vivible in the processing of your results.</p>
<p class="contentcase">8. Improvements to the Experiment</br>
<p class="indentcase">No experiment is 'perfect', here you can write about things you could do differently next time. If you cant think of any, suggest another variable which could be investigated another time and provide a brief provisional hypothesis.</p>
<p class="contentcase">9. Sources of Information Used</br>
<p class="indentcase">List all resources used, include any revision guides or websites used to gain knowledge of the topic, Harvard referencing is advised.</p>
<p class="contentcase">10. Include your results (raw and processed) </br>
<p class="indentcase">This includes any result table containin the recorded results and any graphs you have drawn to illustrate any relationship (these are completed before the write up).</p>
